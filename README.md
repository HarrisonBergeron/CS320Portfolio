The best way to ensure that a program is functional and secure is to test it. Software testing is
a process that can increase the confidence that a program will behave as expected given specific
inputs. Writing a software test could be as simple as making sure that values entered into a program
are correct and being used during program execution, or it could be as complicated as testing many
possible combinations/permutations of program inputs. User needs can be interpreted by picking apart
user stories to figure out what the software requirements are and what is needed versus what is wanted. 
It should be possible to define user needs exactly so that when tests need to be written, it is not
difficult to create test cases. Designing software requires that user needs are prioritized over wants
and nice-to-haves. It might be cost effective to throw together prototypes before an entire program is built
to save time and figure out which features affect others and where potential dependencies may lie.
